{-

  This module is about the homogeneous structure on ℑ(A), 
  where A is a homogeneous type.
  It turns out to be a homogeneous type again 
   -- as well as its 'kernel' 𝔻ₑ

  The arguments are basically the same as those in 'Im.agda' 
  in the section on left invertible structures on ℑ(A),
  for some left invertible A. The homogeneous types are 
  a replacement for the left invertible H-spaces.
