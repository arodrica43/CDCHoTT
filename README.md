# DCHoTT-Agda
Differential cohesion in Homotopy Type Theory by an axiomatized infinitesimal shape modality

# State of the code
Notation is not as consequent and compatible as it should be.
This code grew while I was learning homotopy type theory and agda.
This is still witness by some ugly definitions for the basic stuff like equivalences.
If you want to have a look at what's been formalized, the following file are the right places:
- FormalDiscBundle.agda
- Manifolds.agda

Basic properties of left exact Modalities are not proven yet, so there is a bit of cheating in Im.agda.
